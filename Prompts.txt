please change form input text to black do not make other changes
add a logout button to the website
logout button should only be in profile page
add username to the side of user icon in layout
in the landing page do not show login or signup buttons if logged in do not change anything else
make profile page reflect user data
in profile page only username email and kyc status is showing please fix; also remove
"member since". do not change anything else
now i want the wallet balance in wallet and dashboard to reflect the money a user has. there is 
not an existing wallet/balance model in the database
users need to be able to invest in projects
i need all inputs to be black text coloured
Users need to be able to start new projects
now i need the platform to also allow users to sign in and sign up with google or github
when using oauth sign in it does not direct me to select account
after signing up once in a browser i am not being redirected th enext time i want
to sign up with a different account
Make oauth redirect no matter what
logout is not clearing cookies and local storage
i am still not being redirected so i am not able to select a different account using oauth
i do not get redirected to google to select account
change all oauth prompts to prompt=consent
now google is working as the prompt is consent. i want you to do the same for github
oauth does not check for existing user in sign up. for oauth if user exists when 
sign up i want the application to log them in and go to dashboard, skipping the 
onboarding process
not working logic needs to be in the page.tsx for login and sign up
Login goes to onboarding even though it is not supposed to
it still goes to onboarding when logging in
you can hardcode login to always go to dashboard after user is succesfully logged in
